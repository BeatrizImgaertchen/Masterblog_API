# Building APIs with Flask 

### Project Overview
This project revolves around the creation of a dynamic API using Flask, a versatile web framework in Python. Our API serves as a powerful backend, providing endpoints for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting blog posts. Additionally, we've incorporated features like sorting, searching, and handling cross-origin requests (CORS) for a seamless web development experience.

### Key Features
RESTful API: Designed to follow RESTful principles for simplicity and consistency.
CRUD Operations: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for blog posts.
Sorting and Searching: Implements sorting and searching capabilities for an enhanced user experience.
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): Enables communication with the API from different origins.

### API Endpoints
GET /api/posts: Retrieve a list of blog posts.
POST /api/posts: Add a new blog post.
PUT /api/posts/{post_id}: Update an existing blog post.
DELETE /api/posts/{post_id}: Delete a blog post.
GET /api/posts/search: Search for blog posts based on title or content.
